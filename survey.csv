3-6 years older: I dated someone two years younger than me, and maybe I’m generalizing, but as a female, I feel like I am more similar/can have better conversations and friendships that could turn into relationships with men who are at least one or two years older than me (six is okay, but anything beyond that is a bit weird, at least speaking from speculation). I would date men my age, but even then, I think I’d be interested in men who despite being the same age as me are more mature emotionally beyond their age.
